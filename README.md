# Generator
Resource files generator.

## Notes
This provisional generator is based on a previous one from another project to quickly get out of trouble in a third project. It is not a very elegant implementation, and I'm working in an alternative implementation.

## Install

```shell
$ go get -u https://gitlab.com/mikrowezel/backend/generator
$ alias mw=generator
```

Another option to avoid alias

```shell
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/mikrowezel/backend/generator.git
$ cd generator
$ make install
```
